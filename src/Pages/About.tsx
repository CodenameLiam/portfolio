                    Hey! My name is Liam. Iâ€™m a computer science student at the Queensland
                    University of Technology, and a software engineer at WorkingMouse / Codebots in
                    Brisbane, Australia. My primary drive in life is to improve the lives of others
                    through technology. I just want to build cool stuff, with the hope that what I
                    create will have a lasting impact on those who interact with it. I love tough
                    problems, and I especially love working with a team of like-minded individuals
                    in order to solve them. I have a keen interest in software development, graphic
                    design, cloud computing, data analytics and machine learning.
