                        Hey! My name is Liam. Iâ€™m a computer science student at the Queensland
                        University of Technology, and a software engineer at WorkingMouse / Codebots
                        in Brisbane. My primary drive in life is to improve the lives of others
                        through technology. I love to build cool stuff, with the hope that what I
                        create will have a lasting impact on those who interact with it. I love
                        tough problems, and I especially love working with a team of like-minded
                        individuals in order to solve them. I have a keen interest in software
                        development, graphic design, cloud computing, data analytics and machine
                        learning.
