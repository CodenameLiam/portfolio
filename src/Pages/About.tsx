                    Hey! My name is Liam. Iâ€™m a software engineer at Max Kelsen. I'm also wrapping
                    up my final year as a computer science and electrical engineering student at the
                    Queensland University of Technology. My primary drive in life is to improve the
                    lives of others through technology. I just want to build cool stuff, with the
                    hope that what I create will have a lasting impact on those who interact with
                    it. I love tough problems, and I especially love working with a team of
                    like-minded individuals in order to solve them. I have a keen interest in
                    software development, graphic design, human-computer interaction and machine
                    learning.
